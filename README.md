# A Traffic Environment

## Setup

We recommend starting a new virtual environment: 

```
python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

To run the code, select a recording and run the `main.py` file.

## Results

The resulting collision file will be saved as collision_log.csv in the corresponding recording directory.
